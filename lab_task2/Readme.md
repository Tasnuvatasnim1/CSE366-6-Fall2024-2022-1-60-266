# AI Grid Simulation
AI Grid Simulation is a Python-based interactive simulator designed for learning and visualizing AI concepts such as search algorithms. It enables students and developers to experiment with Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* pathfinding algorithms in a dynamic grid environment. The simulation includes tasks and barriers to challenge and demonstrate the performance of algorithms.

# Search Algorithms: 
Implementation of UCS and A* for task-solving in a grid-based environment.
# Grid Simulation: 
Visualize agent movement with tasks and barriers in a customizable grid.
# Toggle Between Algorithms: 
Switch between UCS and A* with a button click.
# Dynamic Obstacles: 
Randomly placed barriers to simulate real-world constraints.
# Task Management: 
Automatically detect and complete tasks as the agent reaches them.
# Extensible Framework: 
Easily extend to support additional algorithms or environments.

# Installation Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Pygame library

# Steps
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Tasnuvatasnim1/CSE366_labtask2.git
cd AI_Grid_Simulation
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To start the simulation, run: python run.py

# Examples
To run the default simulation: python run.py

# Interacting with the Simulation
Start: Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
Toggle Algorithm: Click "Toggle" to switch between UCS and A*.
Tasks: Observe the agent completing tasks in sequence.
Results: Compare path costs and tasks completed by UCS and A*.
